Frequently asked questions What is a duvet insert? Also known as a “duvet”, a duvet insert is typically fluffier than traditional comforters and quilts because they are filled with down alternative fibers or some other lightweight fill. They’re designed to be used inside a duvet cover. Saatva comforters can be used alone, but we recommend using it like a duvet insert inside our organic duvet covers to keep it clean and protected in between washes. What is the difference between a duvet and a comforter? The terms “comforter” and “duvet” (also known as “duvet insert”) are sometimes used interchangeably. Traditionally, a comforter is meant to be used on its own and doesn’t require a cover. It can either have a decorative print or a solid color. In contrast, a duvet (AKA duvet insert) is designed to be used inside a duvet cover which you can wash and switch out regularly. Duvets are also typically fluffier than traditional comforters and quilts because they are filled with down alternative or some other lightweight fill. Our Saatva All-Year Comforter is actually a hybrid of both. Like a comforter, it can be used on its own without a duvet because it’s super soft and machine washable. Unlike a traditional comforter, it has the cloud-like softness and lightweight breathability of a duvet. We recommend using the All-Year Comforter as a duvet insert inside our duvet covers to give you more versatility and ease when laundry day comes around. What is the best way to wash my down alternative comforter/duvet insert? Machine wash on its own in cold water on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly. Mild, organic detergents work best. How do you insert a duvet into a duvet cover Duvet covers typically have fabric loops on each corner to tie and anchor the corners of the duvet insert to keep it from bunching. Follow these easy steps to insert your duvet insert into your duvet cover: 1. Turn the duvet cover inside out and lay it flat on your mattress, with the opening at the foot of the bed. 2.  Lay the comforter/duvet insert on top of the duvet cover. 3. Tie the ends of the duvet insert to the corresponding corner loops of the duvet cover. 4. Starting at the head of the bed, roll both the duvet cover and comforter/duvet insert together like a burrito toward the foot of the bed. 5. Once at the end, invert the duvet cover opening around the ends of both sides of the “burrito” you just rolled. 6. Zip the duvet cover closed. 7. Unroll the “burrito” back up toward the head of the bed and fluff as needed. Are down alternative comforters hot? Our unique blend of airy 3D down alternative fibers and naturally breathable lyocell absorbs very little body heat while offering a high volume of airflow which allows you to sleep very cool. To make our comforter even cooler, we cover it with naturally breathable percale cotton. Do down alternative comforters shed? Unlike traditional down comforters which can shed some smaller pieces of down filling through the fabric shell, down alternative comforters usually don’t have this issue. They’re also a more hypoallergenic option because they don’t trap allergens like dust mites and pollen like traditional down comforters can. What is lyocell? Lyocell is a semi-synthetic fiber that is a form of rayon composed primarily of cellulose derived from wood pulp. It is a naturally biodegradable fiber that is manufactured in an efficient, eco-friendly process, making it a sustainable alternative to synthetic fibers like polyester. The main benefits of lyocell are its superb breathability, moisture-wicking, and durability. Why is the cotton shell on the comforter / duvet insert a 200-thread count? The short answer: breathability! According to the National Sleep Foundation, the sweet spot for thread count in cotton bedding is between 200 and 400.
            If you tend to sleep hot, a higher thread count may not be a great choice as it tends to trap body heat.
            Sticking to that sweet spot for thread count is a good way to ensure your cotton sheets won't feel too warm. What is GSM? GSM stands for “grams per meter” and refers to the weight of a fabric. In general, the higher the fabric’s GSM, the thicker and warmer it feels. Below are the GSM weights of some of our bedding: • Lightweight Down Alternative Comforter: lightweight 220 GSM • All-Year Down Alternative Comforter: medium-weight 340 GSM • Heavyweight Down Alternative Comforter: heavyweight 420 GSM • Waffle Knit Blanket: medium-weight 320 GSM What is OEKO-TEX®? The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals. What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?
