Ours is made up of long fibers to give it a more refined feel. It also contains natural proteins and amino acids that help soothe the delicate skin around the eyes NATURALLY BREATHABLE Silk is naturally breathable and moisture-wicking, yet it also insulates the skin to prevent moisture loss. Its silky, frictionless surface keeps your skincare products on your skin and away from your pillowcase. SMOOTH YET DURABLE We chose 22 momme silk for its perfect balance of durability and smooth hand feel. “Momme” is the unit used to describe the weight of silk thread. SILKY-SOFT FEEL Extra-smooth charmeuse weave lends an extra luxurious feel to the fabric. It creates a frictionless surface to prevent wrinkles and creases on the skin. How does an eye mask help improve your sleep? It signals your brain that it's time for bed Exposure to artificial light at night can mess with your body's circadian rhythms, which regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Blocking out disruptive blue light and ambient light helps your mind and body wind down to prepare for sleep. How does blue light mess with your sleep? Learn more on our blog. It helps you fall asleep faster A dark environment helps your body produce more of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. It helps you stay asleep longer Exposure to light can disrupt your sleep. Eye masks can help you get more deep, restorative sleep with less disruptions. Eye masks are also great for sleeping in during the day, catching some zzs on the plane, and sleeping in bright rooms without blackout curtains. Curious about the science behind sleep masks?
