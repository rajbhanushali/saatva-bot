A duvet cover is a protective and decorative fabric layer that goes over a duvet (also called a “duvet insert”) and has some type of closure like buttons or zipper. It's a great way to keep your duvet/duvet insert clean. You can also easily change up the look of your bed by switching out your duvet cover. What is the best way to clean my duvet cover? Machine wash on its own in cold water on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly. Mild, organic detergents work best. Are linen duvet covers rough? High quality linen should not feel scratchy or rough. There are various types of linen; some are smoother and have a more consistent feel, while others have a slightly courser texture than cotton. The high-quality linen we use in our Linen Duvet Cover Set comes prewashed for extra softness right out of the package. The best part? They get even softer with every wash. Why are linen duvet covers so good? Linen duvet covers are worth the splurge because of their amazing breathability, durability, and excellent moisture-wicking properties. They're also naturally hypoallergenic, antimicrobial, and anti-static. Linen is highly durable because of its longer and thicker threads. This means your linen bedding can last you for decades to come! Fans of linen sheets also love their relaxed, lived-in look. Do linen duvet covers make you sweat? It's actually quite the opposite! Linen is one of the most breathable natural fabrics around and has excellent moisture-wicking properties. This is a huge plus if you tend to sleep hot or sweat through the night. Can I iron linen duvet cover? Yes. If you prefer a more crisp-looking bed, you can iron your linen duvet cover. Just make sure to follow the care instructions. Linen can wrinkle easily, but part of its appeal is its effortless, relaxed style. How long do linen duvet covers last? Because it typically has longer and thicker threads, linen is a highly durable fabric. This means your linen duvet cover can last you for decades if you take care of them. How can you tell good quality linen? The quality of linen can best be felt in its texture. Whether it's smooth or slightly course, the fabric shouldn't feel scratchy or rough. High-quality linen will typically come prewashed for added softness. Are linen duvet covers cooler than cotton duvet covers? Linen duvet covers are highly breathable and can absorb as much as 20% of its weight in moisture before feeling wet. This makes linen a great year-round option for those who sleep hot or sweat through the night. Because of their lighter, airy feel, linen bedding are great for the summer months, but they can also help regulate your body temperature in colder months. What does a duvet set include? A duvet set comes with a duvet cover and pillowcase/s or shams. Our Saatva duvet sets come with matching shams which are designed to be more decorative and placed over your duvet cover. Depending on the size, a duvet cover set comes with one standard/queen pillowcase or sham for twin-twin XL, or two standard/queen or king size pillowcases or shams for queen and king/Cal king. What is the difference between a duvet and a comforter? The terms “comforter” and “duvet” (also known as “duvet insert”) are sometimes used interchangeably. Traditionally, a comforter is meant to be used on its own and doesn’t require a cover. It can either have a decorative print or a solid color. In contrast, a duvet (AKA duvet insert) is designed to be used inside a duvet cover which you can wash and switch out regularly. Duvets are also typically fluffier than traditional comforters and quilts because they are filled with down alternative or some other lightweight fill. Our Saatva All-Year Comforter is actually a hybrid of both. Like a comforter, it can be used on its own without a duvet because it’s super soft and machine washable. Unlike a traditional comforter, it has the cloud-like softness and lightweight breathability of a duvet. We recommend using the All-Year Comforter as a duvet insert inside our duvet covers to give you more versatility and ease when laundry day comes around. What is a pillow sham? A sham goes over a pillow and its main purpose is decorative. It typically has some sort of border to enhance the look of your pillow. Shams are meant for pillows that sit on top of a made bed. Shams and duvet covers are a quick, easy way to change up the look of your bed setup with the seasons. Unlike regular pillowcases, which have an opening on one end,most pillow shams have an envelope flap in the middle or hidden zippers to conceal the opening for a more finished “top-of-bed” look. What is OEKO-TEX®? The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals. What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?
