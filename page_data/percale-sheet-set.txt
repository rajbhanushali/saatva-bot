Light yet durable Long cotton fibers, or staples, are woven into a crisp percale weave that's naturally very breathable, moisture-wicking, and cool to the touch. Just the right thread count As thread counts rise, fabrics become warmer. We chose a thread count of 200 for the perfect balance of softness and breathability. Our percale cotton sheets are pre-washed for a soft, lived-in feel. Ethically Sourced Every step in crafting our cotton has been guided by our commitment to improving the livelihood of the workers who handcraft our bedding in India. HEALTHIER SLEEP The natural cotton fiber we use in our sheets are free of potentially harmful chemicals and we only use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes. Frequently asked questions What's the difference between percale and sateen cotton? Percale cotton has a crisp feel with a luxe matte finish while sateen cotton has a silky-soft feel with a subtle luster. What's the difference between your percale and linen sheets? Percale sheets are made with cotton fibers and woven into a crisp percale weave. Linen sheets are woven from flax fiber and have a uniquely textured finish. Both are naturally hypoallergenic, antimicrobial, and very breathable. Are cotton sheets cooler than polyester sheets? Absolutely! Natural fibers are typically more breathable than synthetic fibers like polyester. The 100% natural long staple cotton we use for our sheets are 200 thread count for the percale and 300 thread count for the sateen, making it the perfect balance of soft and breathable. Are 200 thread count sheets good? According to the National Sleep Foundation, the sweet spot for thread count in cotton sheets is between 200 and 400. If you tend to sleep hot, a higher thread count may not be a great choice as it tends to trap body heat. Sticking to that sweet spot for thread count is a good way to ensure your cotton sheets won't feel too warm. What's the difference between microfiber sheets and natural cotton sheets? Microfiber sheets are made out of polyester fabric, giving them a soft, stretchy feel. They're more affordable than natural cotton sheets but the drawback is that they're not as breathable as cotton or other natural fibers. They're also not as environmentally friendly to produce because they're made from synthetic fibers. What does thread count mean, and why does it matter? Thread count is the number of horizontal (warp) and vertical (weft) threads in one square inch of cotton fabric. The higher the thread count, the warmer the fabric becomes. Note that thread count is only relevant to cotton sheets. It's also only one indicator of good quality. Cotton sheet thread count can vary from the 100s to 1,000 or higher. The problem is you can only get so many threads into a loom. Some bedding manufacturers might sacrifice thread quality to increase the thread count. We chose a thread count of 300 for our sateen cotton, 200 for our percale cotton, and 180 for our percale cotton-viscose blend to achieve the perfect balance of breathability, softness, and durability. We only use long-staple cotton, made from longer cotton fibers, for a stronger, smoother, more durable fabric. For more about thread count, check out our blog .. What is the best way to wash my sheets? We’re glad you asked! Machine wash cold on a gentle cycle with like colors, tumble dry low. Do not bleach. Mild, organic detergents work best. What is OEKO-TEX®? The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals. What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?
