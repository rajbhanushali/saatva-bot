There’s nothing quite like the buoyant, pressure-free support of natural latex. Our latex goes through a washing process to remove all allergy-causing proteins, so all you’re left with is pure, lasting comfort.

Excellent pressure relief Its buoyant, balanced support relieves pressure points for better sleep. Superb breathability Natural latex is more breathable than polyurethane foams or other synthetic comfort foams. Frequently asked questions What sleep positions work best with the Saatva Pillow? Our unique 3-layer pillow is designed to promote proper spinal alignment for most sleep styles. It offers both firmness and softness while still creating enough height to satisfy side sleepers. The inner layer of shredded natural latex adjusts to almost any sleep position. Are your pillows hypoallergenic? Absolutely. We use hypoallergenic microdenier fiber and hypoallergenic 100% shredded natural latex, all encased in 100% organic cotton. Can I wash a latex pillow? Our Saatva Latex Pillow has a washable organic cotton outer cover and microdenier fiber pillow. Simply unzip the cover, remove the core of shredded natural latex, and machine wash the cover and pillow. Please DO NOT wash the shredded latex core. We recommend washing your pillow twice a year and replacing after 3 years or so. What sleep positions work best with the Latex Pillow? All sleep positions will enjoy optimal support for the head and neck with the Saatva Latex Pillow. The responsive shredded latex foam core and down-like fiber fill offer a great balance of plush comfort and optimal support. It’s also available in two loft heights to accommodate every type of sleeper. What if I have a latex allergy? The natural latex we use in some of our mattresses, as well as our Saatva Latex Pillow and Latex Mattress Topper,  goes through a thorough washing process to remove all allergy-causing proteins. Additionally, the latex layer never actually comes into contact with the skin, making it safe even for those with latex allergies. Are latex pillows safe? Yes. Natural latex pillows are free of harmful chemicals and VOCs (volatile organic compounds), so they won't off-gas (emit an unpleasant chemical odor) in your home. Natural latex is also antimicrobial and resistant to mildew, dust mites, and other indoor allergens. Are latex pillows hot? Natural latex is superbly breathable to keep you cooler and more comfortable through the night. How long do latex pillows last? We recommend replacing your Saatva Latex Pillow after about 3 years of regular use. Is a latex pillow better than a memory foam pillow? It depends on your particular sleep needs. Both latex pillows and memory foam pillows provide excellent head and neck support for different sleep positions.They're also hypoallergenic and inhibit the growth of dust mites and other allergens. If you tend to sleep hot, however, a latex pillow made of 100% natural materials is going to be more breathable than its memory foam counterpart. Is your latex pillow adjustable? Saatva Latex Pillows are not adjustable but they do come in two different loft height options to suit all sleep positions and preferences. What sizes are your pillows? Saatva pillows are available in Queen and King sizes. Below are the dimensions of our pillows: Saatva Latex Pillows Queen 28" x 18" King 34" x 18" Graphite Memory Foam Pillows, Cloud Memory Foam Pillows & Down Alternative Pillows Queen 28" x 16" King 34" x 16" Please note that our pillows are slightly larger than standard queen and king sizes. We recommend using our Saatva pillowcases with your Saatva pillow. What is Fair Trade Certified™ cotton?
