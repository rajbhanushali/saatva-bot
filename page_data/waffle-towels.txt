We recommend tumble drying towels in a low temperature and drying with other towels or bedding. Do not throw in the dryer with clothing, especially ones with zippers and other hardware as these can snag the fibers of your towels. What is the purpose of a waffle towel? Waffle towels are lighter than other towel types yet they retain great absorbency. They're particularly great for humid bathrooms because they dry faster than traditional towels.

Saatva towels come in the following standard sizes: Face towel* 13” x 13” Hand towel* 20” x 30” Bath towel 30” x 58” Bath sheet 40” x 66” *Face towel & hand towel are only available in the 3-pc Bath Towel Set . What's the best way to wash my towels? Machine wash in cold water with like-color towels and bedding. Do not wash with clothing, especially ones with zippers and other hardware as these can snag the fibers of your towels. Tumble dry in low or medium heat. What is OEKO-TEX®?
