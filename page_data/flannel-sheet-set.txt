Warm yet breathable Long staple cotton fibers are woven into the most luxurious flannel textile in a heavyweight 180GSM that keeps you warm while still remaining breathable. Yarn dyed for softness Our flannel sheets are individually yarn dyed for a unique heathered finish and a soft, lived-in feel. Healthier sleep We only use OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 certified cotton to guarantee that our sheets are free of harmful chemicals. Natural cotton is also moisture-wicking and hypoallergenic. Velvety softness & durability Brushed long staple cotton imparts a rich, velvety finish that resists wear and pilling. Frequently asked questions Are flannel sheets warmer than cotton sheets? Flannel is a thicker woven textile that is designed to retain warmth on colder nights ever better than high thread-count cotton. Our flannel cotton has a brushed finish that gives it a rich, velvety texture that’s perfect for cozying up in colder weather. What is the best way to wash my sheets? We’re glad you asked! Machine wash cold on a gentle cycle with like colors, tumble dry low. Do not bleach. Mild, organic detergents work best. What is OEKO-TEX®? The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals. What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?

Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bed sheets.
