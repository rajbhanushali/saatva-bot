Handcrafted with natural, nontoxic, eco-friendly materials, it gives you peace of mind as your baby is cradled in soothing comfort. Two beds in one Flippable design adapts to their unique sleep needs with double-firm support for babies and firm support for toddlers. Healthier sleep GREENGUARD Gold Certified to be free of harmful emissions, formaldehyde, and VOCs (won't off-gas). Naturally hypoallergenic and antimicrobial organic cotton and organic wool, and a chemical-free flame barrier cover create a safer sleep environment for your child. Washable, accident-proof cover Accidents and spills are a breeze to clean with a breathable, removable & washable cover made with organic cotton and treated with a safe, eco-friendly water-repellent treatment. Dual-sided with comfort and safety built into every layer Our breathable crib mattress was designed with two levels of firmness to support every stage of your baby’s growth. Click to view the layers Baby Side Toddler Side 1. Extra-firm support for babies Sturdy support base woven with breathable eucalyptus fiber acts as an extra-firm transition layer above the center coil unit. This extra-firm support is integral at this stage of an infant’s growth to help prevent SIDS and other sleep-related accidents. 2. Edge support The center coil unit sets our crib mattress apart from the rest. It’s made up of 200 recycled steel coils and reinforced with double edge support and center-zone technology to keep your child centered and away from the edges of the crib. Why natural latex? There’s nothing quite like the buoyant, pressure-free support of natural latex. Our latex goes through a washing process to remove all allergy-causing proteins, so all you’re left with is pure, lasting comfort. Frequently asked questions What size is a crib mattress? Standard crib size in North America is anywhere from 27 ¼” to 28” wide and  51 ⅝” to 53” long. Our Saatva Crib Mattress measures 28” by 52”. How do I pick a crib mattress? The most important factor when shopping for a crib mattress is your child’s safety. A baby mattress (or the baby/infant side, if you opt for a flippable version) should be very firm. A firm sleep surface can help prevent SIDS and other sleep-related accidents in infants. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics or AAP, babies should sleep on firm mattresses and out of reach of any soft or plush items for the first year of their life. Another consideration is the safety of the materials themselves. Natural, eco-friendly, nontoxic materials like natural latex, wool, and organic cotton will ensure that your baby isn’t exposed to potentially harmful chemicals and pollutants that can be present in mattresses made with cheaper, synthetic materials. Last but not least, look for a crib mattress with some form of nontoxic water repellency to make accidents and spills easier to clean up. What is a breathable crib mattress? A crib mattress made of naturally breathable materials makes for a healthier, more comfortable, sleep environment for your growing baby. Look for highly-breathable materials like certified organic cotton, eucalyptus fiber, natural wool, and natural latex. Can a crib mattress be used for a toddler? Our flippable/dual-sided crib mattress is great because it grows with your baby. Just flip over to the toddler side once it’s time to make the transition. Infants from newborn to about one year old need a firm sleep surface to prevent SIDS and other sleep-related accidents. Once they become toddlers, they still need a firm bed for optimal support, but with a layer of plush, responsive comfort that adjusts to more movement in their toddler years. What if my baby has a wool allergy? The certified organic New Zealand wool used in our Crib Mattress is washed five times with fresh water to remove lanolin allergens. Lanolin, a natural substance found in wool, is the most common cause of rare wool allergies. Additionally, the wool layer in our mattresses never actually comes into contact with the skin. It’s underneath our soft cover made with naturally hypoallergenic organic cotton. Do Saatva mattresses contain fiberglass or a fiberglass sock? No. We never use fiberglass or toxic chemical flame retardants/barriers in any of our mattresses. Instead, we use either a plant-based flame barrier made of thistle pulp, a Paladin flame barrier made with a blend of poly & rayon fibers, or organic New Zealand wool in our mattresses to meet federal safety standards. See Specifications under "Eco-friendly materials" for more details. How do I clean my mattress? As part of regular maintenance, vacuum your mattress at least twice a year to get rid of dust, crumbs, and other icky things that might be living in there. You can also deodorize your mattress by generously sprinkling it with baking soda. Leave it on for a full day and then vacuum it up to refresh your mattress. Tip: Adding a mattress pad over your mattress gives it an added layer of protection from stains, moisture, and debris. Just make sure to wash your mattress pad regularly. For more mattress care tips, check out our blog . What is GOTS? The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the leading textile processing standard for organic fibers. Fabrics that carry the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria. Our Saatva Crib Mattress features GOTS certified New Zealand wool. What is Cradle to Cradle GOLD Certified™? Cradle to Cradle Certified™ is a globally recognized measure of safer, more sustainable products. The Saatva Crib Mattress has been awarded the Cradle to Cradle GOLD Certified™ seal because it meets the standards in these sustainability categories: material health, material reuse, renewable energy and carbon management, water stewardship, and social fairness. What is OEKO-TEX®? The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals. What is GREENGUARD Gold certified? GREENGUARD Certified products are certified to GREENGUARD standards for low chemical emissions into indoor air during product usage. By purchasing products that carry this certification, you’re helping reduce indoor air pollution and your family’s risk of daily chemical exposure to potentially harmful substances like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phthalates, and formaldehyde. What are the benefits of the Extend protection plan? The Extend protection plan provides peace of mind and financial protection for your mattress investment from accidental damage. This plan covers accidental stains and damage NOT covered by the Saatva mattress warranty , such as rips, tears and stains. This plan does not cover theft or damage caused by abuse or misuse. Plans are effective from the day your mattress is delivered. For more info & FAQs about Extend accident protection, check out our Extend page . Can I try your mattresses in person? Yes! Our Saatva Viewing Rooms are inviting, pressure-free spaces to experience Saatva comfort in real life. What is white glove delivery?

We hand-deliver your mattress and set it up in the room of your choice. We also take away your old mattress and foundation* if you select the "free mattress & foundation removal" at checkout—all at no extra charge!

You get all this for free as part of our premium white glove delivery service. *Note that there are a few items our delivery teams won't take away the following items: Waterbed bases Standard metal bed frames Sleep Number bases Stained and/or damaged mattresses & foundations/box springs What if I need to return my mattress?

Our Crib Mattress is an exception with a 45-day free return. What if I need to exchange my mattress? If you decide to exchange your mattress for another Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at 1-877-672-2882 .

            Once your new mattress is delivered, a new 365-night home trial begins. We’ve learned that the most common reason people exchange is for a different mattress size or height, so be sure to measure the height of your bed frame, adjustable base, and/or foundation/box spring before ordering. You can also call one of our friendly sleep guides for assistance 24/7. Can I expedite the delivery of my mattress? Every Saatva mattress is made to order, which means they don't sit in storage. Occasionally, we can shorten the delivery time when we have a change or cancellation from another order of the exact same product. This allows us to redirect that freshly made and sealed mattress to you. We’d love to help in any way if you need your mattress faster. Our friendly sleep guides are here for you 24/7 at 1-877-672-2882 . What do I do if I think my mattress feels too firm when I receive it? All of our mattresses are made to order and arrive to you factory fresh. That means the high-quality materials inside them need a little bit of time to soften up. You should notice your new mattress begin to conform to your body after a few days. You may even notice continuing improvement for up to a month. Remember that your body will need some time to adjust to a brand new mattress. If you've been sleeping on an old mattress, your body likely got used to it, even if it didn't provide you with adequate support. That's why we give you a generous 365-night home trial to give you time to acclimate to your new mattress. If after a month or so, you still feel that your mattress is too firm (or too soft), give us a call at 1-877-672-2882 and one of our friendly sleep guides will be happy to help you.

Are your phone and store representatives on commission? No. It’s part of our pledge to be honest and transparent about what you’re buying. Saatva is committed to giving you honest guidance, even if it means directing you to another mattress brand that’s a better fit for you. In a regular mattress store environment, a commissioned employee makes more money when they sell you a particular brand, so you may get pressured into a choice that’s not right for you. That’s just not the Saatva way. What are the advantages of mattresses that are made in America? Mattresses made in the U.S.A. must meet strict health, safety, and environmental standards. The U.S. and the E.U. have the toughest regulations, but other countries may not offer the same protections. Knowing where your mattress is made makes it easier to ensure that the manufacturer adheres to guidelines that protect workers from danger and exploitation, such as labor regulations and minimum-wage laws. Reputable mattresses manufacturers (like our network of 19 independent factories across the U.S.) also work to minimize environmental impact by incorporating low-carbon-footprint processes and recycled materials into their products.
