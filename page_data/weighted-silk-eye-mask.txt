Ours is made up of long fibers to give it a more refined feel. It also contains natural proteins and amino acids that help soothe the delicate skin around the eyes NATURALLY BREATHABLE Silk is naturally breathable and moisture-wicking, yet it also insulates the skin to prevent moisture loss. Its silky, frictionless surface keeps your skincare products on your skin and away from your pillowcase. SMOOTH YET DURABLE We chose 22 momme silk for its perfect balance of durability and smooth hand feel.

It creates a frictionless surface to prevent wrinkles and creases on the skin. How does a weighted eye mask help improve your sleep?

A weighted sleep mask contains some type of weighted filler material like microbeads, sand, or glass beads. It provides the same deep pressure stimulation of a weighted blanket, but for tired eyes. What are the advantages of sleeping with a weighted eye mask? Just as a massage therapist might place a warm towel or bean bag over your eyes to promote relaxation, the gentle pressure from a weighted eye mask may help you decompress and relax. It’s great for soothing tired eyes and may even help relieve light headaches. Blocking out light also signals your body to produce more of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. This can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. Are weighted eye masks safe? According to the American Sleep Association, eye masks and weighted eye masks are generally safe to use. However, keep in mind the potential for allergic reactions to the material or filler type. Our eye mask is made with naturally hypoallergenic mulberry silk, making it suitable for sensitive skin. How do I clean my silk eye mask? Hand wash with mild detergent free of enzymes and bleach. Lay flat to dry. Do not tumble dry. Do not dry clean. You can also spot clean as needed using cold water.
