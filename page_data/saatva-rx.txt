Quality you can’t stuff in a box Every handcrafted Saatva mattress is made to order, never compressed and stuffed into a small shipping box. Instead, we deliver it factory-fresh to your room for free. Can a bed in a box deliver the same long-lasting comfort, quality & value? Our years of experience tells us no. Just take a look at a bed in a box going through a compression machine and see for yourself. Watch the video 5 things that can happen to a mattress when it’s compressed & stuffed into a box: It can compromise safety Some mattresses use a fiberglass sock as a flame barrier. When the mattress is folded and rolled, the sock can get damaged, creating tiny fiberglass particles. It can break the foam Some brands use less dense foams to be able to compress their beds. Some of the foam’s cells can break when compressed, reducing its overall lifespan. It can destroy the coils Some brands use thinner coils to be able to compress. When folded and rolled, the center row is usually destroyed or compromised, reducing the mattress lifespan even more. Fun fact: Saatva hybrid mattresses use lower gauged recycled steel coils that are so strong, they’d actually break a compression machine! It can compromise back support The center third of a mattress is where most of your body weight lies. Folding a mattress compromises that crucial area, which can lead to aches and pains. It can reduce the lifespan of the mattress This can mean having to replace your mattress sooner. What starts out like a great deal can end up costing you more in the long run.

Saatva Rx is the first mattress on the market specifically designed to help sleepers dealing with serious & chronic joint and back conditions*. Its’ unique construction was designed to support, cradle, and contour to the body like no other mattress, which may help alleviate the daily aches & discomfort associated with these chronic conditions. *Please note that products and claims on this site and any Company linked sites have not been evaluated by any official institution and are not meant to diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure any illness or disease nor do we promise or guarantee that it will give you relief from any injury or ailment. Can a mattress alleviate joint pain? Yes. Mattresses that contour and conform to the body’s curves help relieve pressure points, which help improve circulation and alleviate joint pain Saatva Rx is designed with multiple layers of body-contouring foams, including our proprietary Rx foam modules which relieve pressure points unlike any other type of mattress. What is the Therapeutic Support Core in Saatva Rx? The Saatva Rx features a new & groundbreaking coil core system called the Therapeutic Support Core. It's made up of our proprietary Rx Foam Module encased on top of individually pocketed coils. The result is a mattress that automatically adjusts and contours to every curve and movement better than any single-layer foam ever could. This virtually eliminates pressure points in problem areas to allow for therapeutic relief and more restorative sleep Do Saatva mattresses contain fiberglass or a fiberglass sock? No. We never use fiberglass or toxic chemical flame retardants/barriers in any of our mattresses. Instead, we use either a plant-based flame barrier made of thistle pulp, a Paladin flame barrier made with a blend of poly & rayon fibers, or organic New Zealand wool in our mattresses to meet federal safety standards. See Specifications under "Eco-friendly materials" for more details. Do I need to flip over or rotate my mattress regularly? Unless you have a dual-sided mattress where each side has a different firmness level, most modern mattresses do not need to be flipped over. You should, however, rotate your mattress regularly to distribute the wear more evenly. We recommend doing this after the first six months, then once a year thereafter. All Saatva mattresses (except the Classic 11.5") come with heavy-duty handles to make rotating and moving easier. How do I clean my mattress? As part of regular maintenance, vacuum your mattress at least twice a year to get rid of dust, crumbs, and other icky things that might be living in there. You can also deodorize your mattress by generously sprinkling it with baking soda. Leave it on for a full day and then vacuum it up to refresh your mattress. Tip: Adding a mattress pad over your mattress gives it an added layer of protection from stains, moisture, and debris. Just make sure to wash your mattress pad regularly. For more mattress care tips, check out our blog . Will my Saatva mattress work with my existing box spring or foundation? You can use your existing box spring or foundation if: You purchased your box spring or foundation within the last 7 years.  Your existing box spring or foundation is in good condition and provides sturdy center support.  You don't mind not having a matching foundation.  NOTE: Saatva HD requires pairing with the HD Foundation for adequate support. Saatva mattresses also work with platform beds , without the need for a foundation. Please make sure your existing platform bed has: A solid, durable surface. If your platform has a slatted support system, make sure the slats are spaced less than 4" apart. If they're not, you can add a 1/2" thick piece of plywood to place on top. This extra layer of support is needed because Saatva mattresses are heavier due to their premium quality materials.  A proper center support. This means you must have a center leg in the middle of your platform bed frame.  NOTE: Must add a solid surface over platform slats such as plywood, masonite board, or bunkie board, when used with the dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattress. If you have any questions, you can reach one of our sleep guides 24/7 at 1-877-672-2882 . What bed frames are Saatva mattresses compatible with? Saatva mattresses are compatible with any bed frame, including our Saatva bed frames. Our dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattresses cannot be placed directly on a platform bed frame with slats. You must cover the slats with a solid material, such as plywood or a bunkie board . Non-platform (standard) bed frames require a foundation and can be paired with any mattress. Note that Saatva HD requires pairing with the HD foundation, which is specifically designed to give it optimal support. What is CertiPUR-US®? Foams that are CertiPUR-US® certified are guaranteed to be low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so you don’t have to worry about off-gassing odors. CertiPUR-US certified foams are also guaranteed to be free of ozone depleters, PBDEs, TDCPP, and TCEP flame retardants, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals, formaldehyde, and phthalates.

            Once your new mattress is delivered, a new 365-night home trial begins. We’ve learned that the most common reason people exchange is for a different mattress size or height, so be sure to measure the height of your bed frame, adjustable base, and/or foundation/box spring before ordering. You can also call one of our friendly sleep guides for assistance 24/7. Can I expedite the delivery of my mattress? Every Saatva mattress is made to order, which means they don't sit in storage. Occasionally, we can shorten the delivery time when we have a change or cancellation from another order of the exact same product. This allows us to redirect that freshly made and sealed mattress to you. We’d love to help in any way if you need your mattress faster. Our friendly sleep guides are here for you 24/7 at 1-877-672-2882 . What do I do if I think my mattress feels too firm when I receive it? All of our mattresses are made to order and arrive to you factory fresh. That means the high-quality materials inside them need a little bit of time to soften up. You should notice your new mattress begin to conform to your body after a few days. You may even notice continuing improvement for up to a month. Remember that your body will need some time to adjust to a brand new mattress. If you've been sleeping on an old mattress, your body likely got used to it, even if it didn't provide you with adequate support. That's why we give you a generous 365-night home trial to give you time to acclimate to your new mattress. If after a month or so, you still feel that your mattress is too firm (or too soft), give us a call at 1-877-672-2882 and one of our friendly sleep guides will be happy to help you.

Are your phone and store representatives on commission? No. It’s part of our pledge to be honest and transparent about what you’re buying. Saatva is committed to giving you honest guidance, even if it means directing you to another mattress brand that’s a better fit for you. In a regular mattress store environment, a commissioned employee makes more money when they sell you a particular brand, so you may get pressured into a choice that’s not right for you. That’s just not the Saatva way. What are the advantages of mattresses that are made in America? Mattresses made in the U.S.A. must meet strict health, safety, and environmental standards. The U.S. and the E.U. have the toughest regulations, but other countries may not offer the same protections. Knowing where your mattress is made makes it easier to ensure that the manufacturer adheres to guidelines that protect workers from danger and exploitation, such as labor regulations and minimum-wage laws. Reputable mattresses manufacturers (like our network of 19 independent factories across the U.S.) also work to minimize environmental impact by incorporating low-carbon-footprint processes and recycled materials into their products.
