DIAMOND QUILT PATTERN The refined 1” diamond stitch pattern lends a classic tailored look and a cozy thickness to the quilt. Organic all the way We only use GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified organic long-staple cotton. It's naturally breathable and hypoallergenic, so it's not only better for the planet, it's better for you. Three ways to enjoy your cotton velvet quilt Use it on its own on warmer nights When you need a lighter layer over your sheets, use the velvet quilt instead of your duvet. Layer it with your duvet on chilly nights If your feet tend to get cold, you can fold the quilt over your duvet at the foot of your bed for an extra layer of warmth. You can also place it under your duvet, hotel style. That way, you have the option of keeping your duvet folded over your legs or layer both over you on extra chilly nights. Cozy up on the couch Our cotton velvet quilt isn’t just for bed. You can easily take it to the couch as a cozy yet lightweight blanket for movie nights or binge watching your favorite shows.

A traditional quilt is made of a three layer construction: a top side textile (typically cotton or linen), a thin middle layer of batting (typically some type of poly, wool, or cotton fill) that determines the warmth of the quilt, and a bottom side textile that is soft to the touch but also more durable. As the name suggests, these three layers are quilted together, usually with a quilt pattern like diamond, channel, pick-stitch, etc. What’s the difference between a quilt and a comforter? Quilts are lighter, thinner, and less lofty than typical comforters or duvet inserts . Quilts are a great option for the warmer months or to add a layer of warmth on top of your comforter. Comforters are warmer and more insulated than quilts on their own because they have more fill material. Quilts sit more flush to your bed than a fluffy, lofty comforter or duvet insert. What is the difference between a blanket and quilt? The main difference is in their construction. A blanket is a single layer that’s either woven, crocheted, or knitted. Blankets vary in thickness and can be used alone or as a layer on top of a top sheet or with a comforter for added warmth. A quilt is constructed with three layers. It has an outer shell consisting of a top and bottom layer, plus a batting or fill made of either wool, down, cotton, polyester, rayon or a combination of those materials. Quilts also serve the same purpose of keeping you warm. It can be used alone or layered with other bedding. What is the best way to clean my quilt? We recommend spot cleaning as needed. You can also machine wash on its own in cold water on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly. Mild, organic detergents work best. What is GOTS? The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the leading textile processing standard for organic fibers. Fabrics that carry the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria.
