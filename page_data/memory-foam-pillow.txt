That's why we give you 45 days to fall in love with your Saatva memory foam pillow. Go ahead; sleep on it. Great sleep shouldn't feel rushed. Frequently asked questions What is a memory foam pillow? This type of pillow is filled with memory foam (also known as viscoelastic foam), a type of high-density polyurethane that softens in response to body heat and pressure. This allows the pillow to contour to your head and neck and spring back into shape when it cools down. What sleep positions work best with the Graphite Memory Foam Pillow? Our uniquely constructed memory foam pillow is designed to contour to the head and neck for optimal comfort and support in all sleep positions, and its thicker height is particularly great for side sleepers. Are memory foam pillows hypoallergenic? Yes! Our memory foam pillows help inhibit the growth of dust mites and other contaminants, making it a great choice if you suffer from indoor allergies. The cover is also made with naturally hypoallergenic, moisture-wicking organic cotton blend. How do I wash my Saatva memory foam pillow? Simply unzip and remove the knit cotton cover from the pillow and machine wash cold in the delicate cycle. Tumble dry low or hang to dry. We recommend spot cleaning the surface of the inner pillow as needed. How does the Graphite Memory Foam Pillow keep me cool? Our Graphite Memory Foam pillow's three layers work together to keep you cool: The soft, breathable cover is made with organic cotton cover and quilted with phase-change material that stays cool to the touch; the memory foam layer features advanced graphite technology that draws heat away; and the proprietary blend of gel-infused memory foams ensures maximum airflow and absorbs heat. Are memory foam pillows safe? Not all memory foams are created equally. We only use CertiPUR-US® certified memory foams to ensure that your mattresses and pillows are free of harmful chemicals, are low in VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and won't off-gas (emit an unpleasant chemical odor) in your home. Are memory foam pillows good for side sleepers? Yes! Because memory foam pillows offer such excellent head and neck support, it's a great choice for a variety of sleep positions How long do memory foam pillows last? A high-quality memory foam pillow should last you three years or more with normal use. Do memory foam pillows flatten? Memory foams respond to body heat and pressure by softening to contour to your body and spring back into shape as the foams cool down. However, just like any cushioning that bears your body weight, it's normal to expect some body impressions after you lie on your memory foam pillow night after night, but it shouldn't flatten out with normal use. It's a good idea to replace your memory foam pillows every three years or so to make sure your pillow is always supportive and hygienic. Are memory foam pillows bad for your neck? No. In fact, because of its ability to mold to your body, it offers excellent pain and pressure relief for your neck and shoulders. What's the difference between latex and memory foam pillows? Latex pillows have a fill and/or core made up of latex rather than memory foam. Natural latex, like the kind we use in our Saatva Latex Pillow , is more generally more durable and breathable than memory foam. What's the difference between memory foam and feather pillows? Feather pillows typically have a combination of down and feather filling. Down refers to the soft inner feathers of a duck or goose. Feathers are courser than down and less insulating. The difference between feather/down pillows vs. memory foam comes down to weight and feel. Because feathers and down are much lighter than memory foams, down pillows feel fluffier and have a higher loft (height or thickness) without adding bulk. Down pillows don't have the same contouring support of memory foam pillows, but the higher the fill weight, the firmer and heavier the down pillow will be, which can offer more support for your head and neck. What's the difference between memory foam and polyester pillows? Polyester pillows are either pillows with a cover made of synthetic polyester fabric or poly blend, or a pillow with a filling made of polyester or poly blend like a down alternative pillow . The difference between polyester pillows vs. memory foam is that polyester pillows have a lighter, airer feel. Memory foam pillows are denser and heavier but give you more contouring head and neck support than a lighter, fluffier pillow. Our down alternative pillow is a great option if you want the airy feel of a down pillow, plus the support of memory fiber clusters in the core. What sizes are your pillows? Saatva pillows are available in Queen and King sizes. Below are the dimensions of our pillows: Saatva Latex Pillows Queen 28" x 18" King 34" x 18" Graphite Memory Foam Pillows, Cloud Memory Foam Pillows & Down Alternative Pillows Queen 28" x 16" King 34" x 16" Please note that our pillows are slightly larger than standard queen and king sizes.

Foams that are CertiPUR-US® certified are guaranteed to be low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so you don’t have to worry about off-gassing odors. CertiPUR-US certified foams are also guaranteed to be free of ozone depleters, PBDEs, TDCPP, and TCEP flame retardants, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals, formaldehyde, and phthalates.
