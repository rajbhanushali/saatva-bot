You can rest easy knowing your bedding is always pure and free of harmful chemicals. Fair trade fabric Our Fair Trade Certified™ organic cotton meets the most rigorous social, environmental, and economic standards. Frequently asked questions What is a sateen weave and why is it preferable? Sateen cotton is woven with long-staple cotton yarn using a one-yarn-over, three-yarn-under weave structure. This technique creates a silky-soft feel known for its luster and drape. Are sateen sheets cool? Our 300 thread count sateen sheets were designed to balance softness and breathability. Are cotton sheets cooler than polyester sheets? Absolutely! Natural fibers are typically more breathable than synthetic fibers like polyester. The 100% natural long staple cotton we use for our sheets are 200 thread count for the percale and 300 thread count for the sateen, making it the perfect balance of soft and breathable. Are 300 thread count sheets good? According to the National Sleep Foundation, the sweet spot for thread count in cotton sheets is between 200 and 400. If you tend to sleep hot, a higher thread count may not be a great choice as it tends to trap body heat. Sticking to that sweet spot for thread count is a good way to ensure your cotton sheets won't feel too warm. What's the difference between microfiber sheets and natural cotton sheets? Microfiber sheets are made out of polyester fabric, giving them a soft, stretchy feel. They're more affordable than natural cotton sheets but the drawback is that they're not as breathable as cotton or other natural fibers. They're also not as environmentally friendly to produce because they're made from synthetic fibers. What's the difference between Egyptian cotton sheets and organic cotton sheets? Organic cotton sheets can be made from a variety of cotton types such as Egyptian cotton or Pima cotton. Fun fact: Egyptian cotton is made from a type of cotton plant that's native to the Nile River Valley, hence it's name! What kind of sheets do hotels use? Luxury hotel sheets are typically made of high-quality long-staple cotton for its blend of softness and durability. You’ll find that most luxury hotels choose pure white sheet sets to create a clean, fresh, and serene sleep environment for their guests. What are organic sheets? Organic bed sheets are made from fibers grown without chemical insecticides or synthetic fertilizers. They're also either undyed or use environmentally-friendly dyes. Sleeping on organic sheets lessens your daily exposure to potentially harmful or skin-irritating chemicals that might be present in non-organic sheets. What does thread count mean, and why does it matter? Thread count is the number of horizontal (warp) and vertical (weft) threads in one square inch of cotton fabric. The higher the thread count, the warmer the fabric becomes. Note that thread count is only relevant to cotton sheets. It's also only one indicator of good quality. Cotton sheet thread count can vary from the 100s to 1,000 or higher. The problem is you can only get so many threads into a loom. Some bedding manufacturers might sacrifice thread quality to increase the thread count. We chose a thread count of 300 for our sateen cotton, 200 for our percale cotton, and 180 for our percale cotton-viscose blend to achieve the perfect balance of breathability, softness, and durability. We only use long-staple cotton, made from longer cotton fibers, for a stronger, smoother, more durable fabric. For more about thread count, check out our blog .. What is the best way to wash my sheets? We’re glad you asked! Machine wash your bedding in cold water, with like colors, on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly—we’ve made our bedding slightly larger to account for natural shrinkage after first wash. Mild, organic detergents work best. What is GOTS? The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the leading textile processing standard for organic fibers. Fabrics that carry the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria. What is Fair Trade Certified™ cotton? Products made with Fair Trade Certified™ cotton are made according to rigorous social, environmental, and economic Fair Trade Standards. This means the farmers and workers behind that product earn additional money from your purchase to empower and uplift their communities. All businesses that work with Fair Trade are held to these rigorous standards, which drive income sustainability, community and individual well-being, empowerment, and environmental stewardship. They include requirements around worker’s rights, fair labor practices, and responsible land management. These standards ensure that goods are made with care for the people and planet.
