Light as air Our proprietary cotton-viscose blend is woven into a lightweight gauze for coziness and warmth without the bulk. Healthier sleep This product has been OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 certified to guarantee that it’s free of harmful chemicals. Irresistibly soft & plush Combined with a thin layer of hypoallergenic poly fill, the gauze weave takes on a cozy-soft feel and a relaxed, lived-in look. Extremely breathable Cotton-viscose blend offers superior breathability. Layer over your duvet for added warmth when temperatures drop or drape on its own over your top sheet if you tend to sleep hot. Three ways to enjoy your lightweight quilt Use it on its own on warmer nights When you just need a lightweight layer over your sheets, use the lightweight quilt instead of your duvet. You can even use it in lieu of a top sheet. Either option is perfect for warm summer nights when breathability is key. Layer it with your duvet on chilly nights If your feet tend to get cold, you can fold the quilt over your duvet at the foot of your bed for an extra layer of warmth. You can also place it under your duvet, hotel style. That way, you have the option of keeping your duvet folded over your legs or layer both over you on extra chilly nights. Cozy up on the couch Our quilt isn’t just for bed. Because it’s so lightweight, you can easily take it to the couch as a blanket for movie nights or binge watching your favorite shows. Frequently asked questions What is a quilt? A traditional quilt is made of a three layer construction: a top side textile (typically cotton or linen), a thin middle layer of batting (typically some type of poly, wool, or cotton fill) that determines the warmth of the quilt, and a bottom side textile that is soft to the touch but also more durable. As the name suggests, these three layers are quilted together, usually with a quilt pattern like diamond, channel, pick-stitch, etc. What’s the difference between a quilt and a comforter? Quilts are lighter, thinner, and less lofty than typical comforters or duvet inserts . Quilts are a great option for the warmer months or to add a layer of warmth on top of your comforter. Comforters are warmer and more insulated than quilts on their own because they have more fill material. Quilts sit more flush to your bed than a fluffy, lofty comforter or duvet insert. What is the difference between a blanket and quilt? The main difference is in their construction. A blanket is a single layer that’s either woven, crocheted, or knitted. Blankets vary in thickness and can be used alone or as a layer on top of a top sheet or with a comforter for added warmth. A quilt is constructed with three layers. It has an outer shell consisting of a top and bottom layer, plus a batting or fill made of either wool, down, cotton, polyester, rayon or a combination of those materials. Quilts also serve the same purpose of keeping you warm. It can be used alone or layered with other bedding. What’s the difference between cotton and viscose? While cotton is a natural fiber woven from cotton plant seed pods, viscose is a manufactured fiber made from regenerated cellulose fibers (wood pulp) and is a part of the rayon family of fabrics. It is sometimes referred to as “rayon viscose”. Both offer excellent breathability and a soft feel. Cotton is the more durable fabric of the two, especially when it absorbs moisture. Viscose is less durable, but when blended with cotton, it imparts a silky luster, extra softness, and a nice drape to the fabric. What is OEKO-TEX®? The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals. What is your return policy for bedding & bath products?
