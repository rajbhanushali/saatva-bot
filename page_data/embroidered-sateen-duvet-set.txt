Every Embroidered Sateen Duvet Cover Set is also made with respect for the environmental resources that make it possible. Frequently asked questions What is a duvet cover? A duvet cover is a protective and decorative fabric layer that goes over a duvet (also called a “duvet insert”) and has some type of closure like buttons or zipper. It's a great way to keep your duvet/duvet insert clean. You can also easily change up the look of your bed by switching out your duvet cover. What is the best way to clean my duvet cover? Machine wash on its own in cold water on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly. Mild, organic detergents work best. What's the difference between percale and sateen cotton? Percale cotton has a crisp feel with a luxe matte finish while sateen cotton has a silky-soft feel with a subtle luster. What is a sateen weave and why is it preferable? Sateen cotton is woven with long-staple cotton yarn using a one-yarn-over, three-yarn-under weave structure. This technique creates a silky-soft feel known for its luster and drape. What does a duvet set include? A duvet set comes with a duvet cover and pillowcase/s or shams. Our Saatva duvet sets come with matching shams which are designed to be more decorative and placed over your duvet cover. Depending on the size, a duvet cover set comes with one standard/queen pillowcase or sham for twin-twin XL, or two standard/queen or king size pillowcases or shams for queen and king/Cal king. What is the difference between a duvet and a comforter? The terms “comforter” and “duvet” (also known as “duvet insert”) are sometimes used interchangeably. Traditionally, a comforter is meant to be used on its own and doesn’t require a cover. It can either have a decorative print or a solid color. In contrast, a duvet (AKA duvet insert) is designed to be used inside a duvet cover which you can wash and switch out regularly. Duvets are also typically fluffier than traditional comforters and quilts because they are filled with down alternative or some other lightweight fill. Our Saatva All-Year Comforter is actually a hybrid of both. Like a comforter, it can be used on its own without a duvet because it’s super soft and machine washable. Unlike a traditional comforter, it has the cloud-like softness and lightweight breathability of a duvet. We recommend using the All-Year Comforter as a duvet insert inside our duvet covers to give you more versatility and ease when laundry day comes around. What is a pillow sham? A sham goes over a pillow and its main purpose is decorative. It typically has some sort of border to enhance the look of your pillow. Shams are meant for pillows that sit on top of a made bed. Shams and duvet covers are a quick, easy way to change up the look of your bed setup with the seasons. Unlike regular pillowcases, which have an opening on one end,most pillow shams have an envelope flap in the middle or hidden zippers to conceal the opening for a more finished “top-of-bed” look. Are 300 thread count sheets good? According to the National Sleep Foundation, the sweet spot for thread count in cotton sheets is between 200 and 400. If you tend to sleep hot, a higher thread count may not be a great choice as it tends to trap body heat. Sticking to that sweet spot for thread count is a good way to ensure your cotton sheets won't feel too warm. What does thread count mean, and why does it matter? Thread count is the number of horizontal (warp) and vertical (weft) threads in one square inch of cotton fabric. The higher the thread count, the warmer the fabric becomes. Note that thread count is only relevant to cotton sheets. It's also only one indicator of good quality. Cotton sheet thread count can vary from the 100s to 1,000 or higher. The problem is you can only get so many threads into a loom. Some bedding manufacturers might sacrifice thread quality to increase the thread count. We chose a thread count of 300 for our sateen cotton, 200 for our percale cotton, and 180 for our percale cotton-viscose blend to achieve the perfect balance of breathability, softness, and durability. We only use long-staple cotton, made from longer cotton fibers, for a stronger, smoother, more durable fabric. For more about thread count, check out our blog .. What is GOTS? The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the leading textile processing standard for organic fibers. Fabrics that carry the GOTS symbol must be made with at least 95% organic fiber, free of toxic chemicals, colored with nontoxic dyes, and meet strict social and environmental criteria. What are Fair Trade Certified™ factories? Products from Fair Trade Certified™ factories are made according to rigorous social, environmental, and economic Fair Trade Standards. This means the farmers and workers behind that product earn additional money from your purchase to empower and uplift their communities. All businesses that work with Fair Trade are held to these rigorous standards, which drive income sustainability, community and individual well-being, empowerment, and environmental stewardship.
