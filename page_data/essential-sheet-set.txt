Superbly soft & smooth feel Long percale cotton fibers, or staples, are woven with eco-friendly viscose for softness, a smooth hand feel and added wrinkle resistance. Just the right thread count As thread counts rise, fabrics become warmer. We chose a thread count of 180 for superb breathability while maintaining durability. Healthier sleep This product has been OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 certified to guarantee that it’s free of harmful chemicals. Frequently asked questions What’s the difference between cotton and viscose? While cotton is a natural fiber woven from cotton plant seed pods, viscose is a manufactured fiber made from regenerated cellulose fibers (wood pulp) and is a part of the rayon family of fabrics. It is sometimes referred to as “rayon viscose”. Both offer excellent breathability and a soft feel. Cotton is the more durable fabric of the two, especially when it absorbs moisture. Viscose is less durable, but when blended with cotton, it imparts a silky luster, extra softness, and a nice drape to the fabric. Are 180 thread count sheets good? If you tend to sleep hot, a lower thread count sheet is actually a better option than higher ones as it allows for better airflow. Our cotton-viscose sheet has 180 thread count with a blend of long-staple cotton and viscose for the perfect balance of softness, durability, and superb breathability. This also allows us to offer luxury bedding at a great price point. What does thread count mean, and why does it matter? Thread count is the number of horizontal (warp) and vertical (weft) threads in one square inch of cotton fabric. The higher the thread count, the warmer the fabric becomes. Note that thread count is only relevant to cotton sheets. It's also only one indicator of good quality. Cotton sheet thread count can vary from the 100s to 1,000 or higher. The problem is you can only get so many threads into a loom. Some bedding manufacturers might sacrifice thread quality to increase the thread count. We chose a thread count of 300 for our sateen cotton, 200 for our percale cotton, and 180 for our percale cotton-viscose blend to achieve the perfect balance of breathability, softness, and durability. We only use long-staple cotton, made from longer cotton fibers, for a stronger, smoother, more durable fabric. For more about thread count, check out our blog .. What is the best way to wash my sheets? We’re glad you asked! Machine wash your bedding in cold water, with like colors, on a gentle cycle. Do not bleach. Tumble dry low and remove promptly—we’ve made our bedding slightly larger to account for natural shrinkage after first wash. Mild, organic detergents work best. What is OEKO-TEX®? The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is the internationally accepted standard for certifying textiles and home furnishings. Products that carry the OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 seal have been tested to ensure they're free of toxic chemicals. What is your return policy for bedding & bath products? Bedding and bath products returned within 45 days of the delivery date will get a full refund to the original form of payment. There are no restocking or penalty fees for used products, but we do ask that you wash any used products before returning. To make a bedding or bath return, simply call 1-877-672-2882 or email info@saatvamattress.com . If you received our bedding as a gift, please call us for help with your return. What is the exchange policy for bedding? At this time we do not have an exchange policy for Saatva bedding. If you would like to exchange your merchandise, simply return your order and repurchase the item of your choice. Will you offer more colors in the future? Our current bedding color options are thoughtfully curated to fit a more neutral color palette because they complement almost any room style with timeless simplicity. In keeping with our eco-friendly ethos, we either leave the natural fabric undyed in its beautiful natural state or use nontoxic, eco-friendly dyes for our bedding.
