Frequently asked questions What is a memory foam pillow? This type of pillow is filled with memory foam (also known as viscoelastic foam), a type of high-density polyurethane that softens in response to body heat and pressure. This allows the pillow to contour to your head and neck and spring back into shape when it cools down. What sleep positions work best with the Cloud Memory Foam Pillow? The Cloud Memory Foam Pillow contours and conforms to your head and neck in any sleep position. Are memory foam pillows hypoallergenic? Yes! Our memory foam pillows help inhibit the growth of dust mites and other contaminants, making it a great choice if you suffer from indoor allergies. The cover is also made with naturally hypoallergenic, moisture-wicking organic cotton blend. How do I wash my Saatva memory foam pillow? Simply unzip and remove the knit cotton cover from the pillow and machine wash cold in the delicate cycle. Tumble dry low or hang to dry. We recommend spot cleaning the surface of the inner pillow as needed. Are memory foam pillows safe? Not all memory foams are created equally. We only use CertiPUR-US® certified memory foams to ensure that your mattresses and pillows are free of harmful chemicals, are low in VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and won't off-gas (emit an unpleasant chemical odor) in your home. Are memory foam pillows good for side sleepers? Yes! Because memory foam pillows offer such excellent head and neck support, it's a great choice for a variety of sleep positions How long do memory foam pillows last? A high-quality memory foam pillow should last you three years or more with normal use. Do memory foam pillows flatten? Memory foams respond to body heat and pressure by softening to contour to your body and spring back into shape as the foams cool down. However, just like any cushioning that bears your body weight, it's normal to expect some body impressions after you lie on your memory foam pillow night after night, but it shouldn't flatten out with normal use. It's a good idea to replace your memory foam pillows every three years or so to make sure your pillow is always supportive and hygienic. Are memory foam pillows bad for your neck? No. In fact, because of its ability to mold to your body, it offers excellent pain and pressure relief for your neck and shoulders. What sizes are your pillows? Saatva pillows are available in Queen and King sizes. Below are the dimensions of our pillows: Saatva Latex Pillows Queen 28" x 18" King 34" x 18" Graphite Memory Foam Pillows, Cloud Memory Foam Pillows & Down Alternative Pillows Queen 28" x 16" King 34" x 16" Please note that our pillows are slightly larger than standard queen and king sizes.

CertiPUR-US certified foams are also guaranteed to be free of ozone depleters, PBDEs, TDCPP, and TCEP flame retardants, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals, formaldehyde, and phthalates.
